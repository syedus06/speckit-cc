# User Guide

A comprehensive guide to using Spec Workflow MCP for AI-assisted software development.

## Getting Started

### What is Spec Workflow MCP?

Spec Workflow MCP is a Model Context Protocol server that provides structured, spec-driven development tools to AI assistants. It helps you:

- Create detailed specifications before coding
- Track implementation progress
- Manage approvals and revisions
- Maintain project documentation

### Basic Workflow

1. **Create a spec** - Define what you want to build
2. **Review and approve** - Ensure specifications meet requirements
3. **Implement tasks** - Execute the implementation plan
4. **Track progress** - Monitor completion status

## Creating Specifications

### Simple Spec Creation

Ask your AI assistant to create a spec:

```
"Create a spec for user authentication"
```

The AI will automatically:
1. Create a requirements document
2. Design the technical approach
3. Break down implementation into tasks

### Detailed Spec Creation

Provide more context for better specifications:

```
"Create a spec called payment-gateway with the following features:
- Credit card processing
- PayPal integration
- Subscription management
- Webhook handling for payment events"
```

### From Existing Documents

Use your existing PRD or design documents:

```
"Build a spec from @product-requirements.md"
```

## Managing Specifications

### Listing All Specs

```
"List all my specs"
```

Returns:
- Spec names
- Current status
- Progress percentage
- Document states

### Checking Spec Status

```
"Show me the status of the user-auth spec"
```

Provides:
- Requirements approval status
- Design approval status
- Task completion progress
- Detailed task breakdown

### Viewing Spec Documents

Use the dashboard or VSCode extension to:
- Read requirements documents
- Review design documents
- Browse task lists
- Track implementation progress

## Working with Tasks

### Task Structure

Tasks are organized hierarchically:
- **1.0** - Major sections
  - **1.1** - Subtasks
  - **1.2** - Subtasks
    - **1.2.1** - Detailed steps

### Implementing Tasks

#### Method 1: Direct Implementation
```
"Implement task 1.2 from the user-auth spec"
```

#### Method 2: Copy from Dashboard
1. Open the dashboard
2. Navigate to your spec
3. Click "Tasks" tab
4. Click "Copy Prompt" button next to any task
5. Paste into your AI conversation

#### Method 3: Batch Implementation
```
"Implement all database setup tasks from user-auth spec"
```

### Task Status

Tasks have three states:
- ⏳ **Pending** - Not started
- 🔄 **In Progress** - Currently being worked on
- ✅ **Completed** - Finished

## Approval Workflow

### Requesting Approval

When documents are ready for review:

1. The AI automatically requests approval
2. Dashboard shows notification
3. Review the document
4. Provide feedback or approve

### Approval Actions

- **Approve** - Accept the document as-is
- **Request Changes** - Provide feedback for revision
- **Reject** - Start over with new requirements

### Revision Process

1. Provide specific feedback
2. AI revises the document
3. Review updated version
4. Approve or request further changes

## Bug Workflow

### Reporting Bugs

```
"Create a bug report for login failure when using SSO"
```

Creates:
- Bug description
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Priority and severity

### Bug Resolution

```
"Create a fix for bug #123 in user-auth spec"
```

Generates:
- Root cause analysis
- Fix implementation plan
- Testing requirements
- Deployment steps

## Template System

### Using Templates

Spec Workflow includes templates for:
- Requirements documents
- Design documents
- Task lists
- Bug reports
- Steering documents

### Custom Templates

Create your own templates in `.spec-workflow/templates/`:

```markdown
# Custom Feature Template

## Overview
[Feature description]

## User Stories
[User stories]

## Technical Requirements
[Technical details]
```

## Advanced Features

### Steering Documents

Create high-level project guidance:

```
"Create steering documents for my e-commerce project"
```

Generates:
- **Product steering** - Vision and goals
- **Technical steering** - Architecture decisions
- **Structure steering** - Project organization

### Archive System

Manage completed specs:
- Move finished specs to archive
- Keep active workspace clean
- Access archived specs anytime
- Restore specs when needed

### Multi-Language Support

Change interface language:

1. **Dashboard**: Settings → Language
2. **VSCode Extension**: Extension Settings → Language
3. **Config file**: `lang = "ja"` (or other language code)

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with Steering Documents

Before creating specs:
```
"Create steering documents to guide the project"
```

### 2. Be Specific in Requirements

Good:
```
"Create a spec for user authentication with:
- Email/password login
- OAuth2 (Google, GitHub)
- 2FA support
- Password reset flow"
```

Not ideal:
```
"Create a login spec"
```

### 3. Review Before Implementation

Always review and approve:
1. Requirements document
2. Design document
3. Task breakdown

### 4. Implement Incrementally

- Complete tasks in order
- Test after each major section
- Update task status regularly

### 5. Use the Dashboard

The dashboard provides:
- Visual progress tracking
- Easy document navigation
- Quick approval actions
- Real-time updates

## Common Workflows

### Feature Development

1. Create spec: `"Create spec for shopping-cart feature"`
2. Review requirements in dashboard
3. Approve or request changes
4. Review design document
5. Approve design
6. Implement tasks sequentially
7. Track progress in dashboard

### Bug Fixing

1. Report bug: `"Create bug report for checkout error"`
2. Analyze: `"Analyze root cause of bug #45"`
3. Plan fix: `"Create fix plan for bug #45"`
4. Implement: `"Implement the fix"`
5. Verify: `"Create test plan for bug #45 fix"`

### Refactoring

1. Create spec: `"Create spec for database optimization"`
2. Document current state
3. Design improvements
4. Plan migration steps
5. Implement incrementally
6. Verify each step

## Tips and Tricks

### Efficient Task Management

- Use task grouping for related items
- Copy prompts from dashboard for accuracy
- Mark tasks complete immediately after finishing

### Document Management

- Keep requirements concise but complete
- Include acceptance criteria
- Add technical constraints in design
- Reference external documents when needed

### Collaboration

- Use approval comments for feedback
- Share dashboard URL with team
- Export documents for external review
- Track changes through revision history

## Integration with AI Assistants

### Contextual Awareness

The AI assistant automatically:
- Knows your project structure
- Understands spec relationships
- Tracks implementation progress
- Maintains consistency

### Natural Language Commands

Speak naturally:
- "What specs do I have?"
- "Show me what's left to do"
- "Start working on the next task"
- "Update the design for better performance"

### Continuous Workflow

The AI maintains context between sessions:
- Resume where you left off
- Reference previous decisions
- Build on existing work
- Maintain project coherence
